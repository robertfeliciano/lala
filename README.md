# lala-parser
Testing ground for the parser for my language, Lala. 

Lala uses a parsing expression grammar (PEG) and uses [pest](https://pest.rs/), a Rust library, for generating the parser.

Lala is a simple scripting language to quickly solve linear algebra problems. 

It is inspired by array programming languages like APL and J, but specializing in matrix functions.

This is where I can test new syntactical additions to the language.
